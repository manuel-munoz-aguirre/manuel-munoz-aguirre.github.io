## Who am I    
Hello! My name is Manuel Muñoz Aguirre. I am a PhD candidate in [Statistics and Operations Research](https://www.eio.upc.edu/ca), at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, and doing my thesis work at the [Computational Biology of RNA Processing Lab](http://www.crg.eu/roderic_guigo?page=5) with the supervision of [Dr. Roderic Guigó](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nUDzsZsAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Jan Graffelman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q-cpWSsAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Interests
I'm all about generating knowledge from data to solve interdisciplinary problems and being able to communicate a compelling story. Interested in several research areas of data mining and machine learning, in particular, regularization/feature selection, latent variable models, kernels and high-dimensional statistical learning. I am also a fan of the Final Fantasy and Zelda series :) and an amateur photographer.

## Skills
Cybernetics Electronics engineer, with a double degree in Mechatronics. Master in Data Science and Knowledge Management. I use R for quick exploratory analyses (dplyr, data.table, ggplot2, caret) and Python for heavy duty machine learning/data processing (scikit-learn, pandas, keras) tasks. Check out my [github profile](https://github.com/manuel-munoz-aguirre) for some examples, and my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelmunozaguirre/) for a detailed list of skills.
